# Cypress Workshop

This is the source code for my Cypress Workshop, which aims to go through some light basics, and then more hidden features, of using Cypress to test a real web app.

This workshop uses an example project from [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) to serve as the web app to test.

The workshop goes through the following Cypress concepts:

- Assertions
- Browser events (clicks etc)
- Commands
- Fixtures
- Plugins (cypress-axe)
